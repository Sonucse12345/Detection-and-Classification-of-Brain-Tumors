# Detection-and-Classification-of-Brain-Tumors


Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with PyTorch to enhance detection
and classification of brain tumors from MRI scans. Using image augmentation, a carefully selected loss function, and optimizer, trained CNN on 60 epoch achieves 97% accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score all at 0.97. model correctly identified 489 cases as brain tumors (53.09%
of cases) and 405 cases as healthy (43.97% of cases), with minimal errors: 14 false positives
(1.52%) and 13 false negatives (1.41%). modelâ€™s efficiency and accuracy in neuro-oncology,
aiming to improve diagnostic processes and patient outcomes.
